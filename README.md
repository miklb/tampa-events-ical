# Tampa Events iCal feed

When I started this, The City of Tampa has a great website with a list of events happening in the city. The website is located at [https://www.tampagov.net/events](https://www.tampagov.net/events). There's also an RSS feed for that page. And for each event, there's an iCal link. But there wasn't single iCal feed for all events.

So I reached out to the great folks in Technology and Innovation at the City of Tampa and they provided me with a JSON feed of all events. This repo runs a GitHub Action once a morning to fetch the JSON feed and generate an iCal feed with all events.

Subsequently they've contributed back to the project with a lot of improvements including separating out the feeds. My understanding is they will be starting to roll out the links hosted on their infrastructure on tampa.gov themselves. I'll keep this up as a one stop link to all of the feeds.
