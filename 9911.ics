LOCATION:Tampa \, FL United States
DESCRIPTION:Saying Im fine can be short and sweet but doesnt usually give 
 an accurate description of our emotions. Sometimes we use\, Im fine to mas
 k feelings\, avoid conflict\, and pretend that everything is okay. This pr
 esentation will explore what it means to minimize\, ways we can acknowledg
 e and honor how we feel in the present moment and how we can take ownershi
 p of our emotions in the new year to navigate us to our authentic selves.
