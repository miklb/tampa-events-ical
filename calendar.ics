SUMMARY:New Exhibition: The Etruscans: A Mysterious Italian People
LOCATION:120 W Gasparilla Plaza Tampa\, FL 33602 Tampa \, FL 33602 United 
 States
DESCRIPTION:The Etruscans are a fascinating ancient Italian people about w
 hom much remains a mystery. They inhabited an area of central Italy  prese
 nt-day Tuscany and beyond  immediately north of Latium where the city Rome
  later rose to power. Emerging from the Iron Age Villanovan culture (ca. 9
 00-700 bce)\, the Etruscans reached their zenith in the second quarter of 
 the first millennium bce. Over the centuries\, Etruscan art and culture re
 tained its distinct identity. Yet\, they were variously influenced by Celt
 ic and Central European\, Roman and Greek\, Punic and Phoenician civilizat
 ions. The Etruscans were gradually subsumed by Rome over the course of a l
 ong process of acculturation (ca. 5th-1st cent. bce). \n\nPermalink: https

LOCATION:Tampa \, FL United States
DESCRIPTION:Wednesday\, June 25\, 2025 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM One-half of all 
 working Americans admit to having back pain symptoms. Experts estimate tha

 aused by serious conditions\, such as infection or fracture. Rather\, they
  are mechanical\, meaning the pain originates from the joints\, bones or s
 oft tissues in and around the spine. If we improve our body mechanics\, we
  may be able to prevent or correct most of the causes of back pain. After 
 this presentation\, you will be able to:  Define some of the anatomy of yo
 ur back and spine  Learn about the common causes and risks for back pain
