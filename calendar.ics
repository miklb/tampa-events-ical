SUMMARY:Public Workshop - Multi-Modal Transportation Impact Fee
LOCATION:315 E Kennedy Blvd Tampa \, FL 33602 United States
DESCRIPTION:PUBLIC NOTICE OF PUBLIC WORKSHOP TAMPA CITY COUNCIL Two public
  workshops on a proposed increase to the Multi-Modal Transportation Impact
  Fee will be held by the City Council of the City of Tampa\, Florida\, on 
 September 25\, 2025\, and October 30\, 2025\, at 9:00 a.m. or as soon ther
 eafter as practicable\, in the City Council Chambers\, 3 rd Floor\, City H
 all\, 315 East Kennedy Boulevard\, Tampa\, Florida. Section 163.31801\, Fl
 orida Statutes\, authorizes local governments to adopt impact fees to fund
  the infrastructure necessitated by new growth. The Legislature recognizes
  that impact fees are an outgrowth of the home rule power of a local gover
 nment to provide certain services within its jurisdiction. The City of Tam
 pa originally adopted a Transportation Impact Fee in 1986 and in 2015 upda
 ted its fee structure to a Multi-Modal Transportation Impact Fee to incorp
 orate additional transit modes. The City of Tampa is considering an increa
 se to its Multi-Modal Transportation Impact Fee. Section 163.31801\, Flori
 da Statutes\, provides certain phase-in limitations that restrict a local 
 governments ability to increase the fee beyond certain thresholds. Pursuan
 t to section 163.31801(6)(g)\, Florida Statutes\, the City of Tampa may in
 crease its fee over the threshold set out in section 163.31801(6)(d)\, Flo
 rida Statutes. In addition to other statutory requirements\, the City of T
 ampa may increase its Multi-Modal Transportation Impact Fee above the thre
 shold after holding two publicly noticed workshops to consider the extraor
 dinary circumstances necessitating the need to exceed the statutory phase-
 in limitations. At the public workshops to be held on September 25\, 2025\
 , and October 30\, 2025\, at 9:00 a.m. or as soon thereafter as practicabl
 e\, in the City Council Chambers\, 3 rd Floor\, City Hall\, 315 East Kenne
 dy Boulevard\, Tampa\, Florida\, the City Council will consider whether th
 ese extraordinary circumstances exist. Interested members of the public ma
 y participate and be heard at this public workshop by either appearing in 
 person or virtually by using what is referred to by State of Florida statu
 tes and rules as communications media technology (CMT) as described below.
