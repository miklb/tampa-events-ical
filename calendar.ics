SUMMARY:BLACK LOVE Classics Series - Carmen Jones
LOCATION:711 N. Franklin Street Tampa \, FL 33602 United States
DESCRIPTION:A unique project from Otto Preminger\, Carmen Jones is a moder
 nized (as of 1954\, anyway) take on the classic Georges Bizet opera Carmen
  . In this version\, Carmen (Dorothy Dandridge) is a flighty\, flirty fact
 ory worker who gets in trouble and has to be delivered to jail by a milita
 ry guard\, Joe\, (Harry Belafonte). He falls for her\, which Carmen finds 
 appealing\, if funny  and which his fiance\, Cindy Lou\, emphatically does
  not. If youre familiar with the opera\, or opera in general\, you know th
 is turns out poorly for all involved. A vivid and lively musical with a ti
 mely and humanistic flavor\, Carmen Jones is a one-of-a-kind mashup of the
 mes and emotions that are timeless in every way. Guests are invited to sta
 y after the screening for the film talk The Staccato Notes of Identity in 
 Carmen Jones\, led by Taylor Raye Curry\, Associate Professor of Film at U
 niversity of Tampa. The Black Love Classic Movie Series is presented by Ta
 mpa Electric (TECO) in collaboration with the City of Tampas Community Eng
 agement Partnerships Department. Post-show Film Talks are sponsored by Hun
 gry Bull Productions and the Restaino Family Foundation. Promotional suppo
 rt provided by WEDU PBS. \n\nPermalink: https://www.tampa.gov/node/180666

SUMMARY:Memorial Remembrance Ceremony in honor of Detective Juan Serrano
LOCATION:Tampa \, FL United States
DESCRIPTION:NEVER FORGOTTEN The Tampa Police Department will join the Tamp
 a Police Memorial Committee to honor Detective Juan Serrano\, 20 years aft
 er his ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Detective Serranos life and
  career were defined by a profound commitment to public service. Joining t
 he department in 1989\, he served with distinction across various roles\, 
 including Uniform Patrol and the Gang Unit\, before being assigned to the 
 Criminal Intelligence Bureau. In addition to his primary duties\, Detectiv
 e Serrano served as a vital member of the Mayors security detail. On the e
 vening of February 25\, 2006\, Detective Serrano was traveling home follow
 ing an assignment with Mayor Pam Iorio during the Gasparilla Distance Clas
 sic. As his unmarked vehicle entered the intersection at the southbound I-
 75 exit ramp and Gibsonton Drive\, a second vehicle traveling at a high ra
 te of speed ran a red light. The vehicle struck Detective Serranos car bro
 adside at the drivers door. Despite the efforts of first responders and me
 dical staff at Tampa General Hospital\, Detective Serrano succumbed to the
  injuries sustained in the crash. The occupants of the striking vehicle fl
 ed the scene on foot\, but the driver was later apprehended and charged fo
 r his role in the tragic collision. Detective Serranos dedication to the C
 ity of Tampa was evident in every assignment he held. His loss was felt de
 eply by his colleagues\, the Mayors office\, and the community he spent se
 venteen years protecting. His legacy remains a testament to the selfless n
 ature of those who serve behind the badge. To honor his memory and the unw
 avering commitment of all our fallen heroes\, the Tampa Police Department 
 will host a Memorial Remembrance Ceremony on Wednesday\, February 25\, 202
 6\, at 11:30 am in front of the Monument to Fallen Officers outside Tampa 
 Police Headquarters. The ceremony will feature a tribute by the Tampa Poli
 ce Honor Guard\, a solemn reminder of the sacrifices made by Detective Jua
 n Serrano and all who serve to protect our community. For those unable to 
 attend in person\, the ceremony will be live streamed at www.facebook.comT
 ampaPD (http:www.facebook.comTampaPD). \n\nPermalink: https://www.tampa.go

SUMMARY:Finding Neutral
LOCATION:211 South Howard Ave Tampa \, FL 33606 United States
DESCRIPTION:Reclaiming the Time-In-Between A Somatic Journey into Flow\, P
 resence Nervous System Ease In music\, dance\, and poetry\, it is the tran
 sitions  the rests\, the pauses\, the moments between movements  that give
  everything meaning. Yet in modern life\, these spaces are disappearing. E
 very spare second is captured\, monetized\, and filled. We are pulled towa
 rd constant stimulation\, leaving almost no room for the quiet inner rhyth
 ms that regulate creativity\, intuition\, and wellbeing. This workshop is 
 an invitation to reclaim those time-in-between spaces and return to a natu
 ral state of flow  a place where the gears of go\, go\, go finally disenga
 ge. Mind and body need this extended neutral between gears: a place where 
 the mind settles\, the body softens\, and the nervous system can exhale. T
 hrough gentle movement\, breathwork\, somatic sensing\, and guided awarene
 ss\, youll explore: how to shift from sympathetic overdrive into parasympa
 thetic ease the role of the vagus nerve in emotional regulation and creati
 ve access how staring into space\, drifting\, and daydreaming are importan
 t for a healthy mind and body what it feels like to inhabit spaciousness r
 ather than urgency This workshop is fully experiential. Learning and doing

 oposals for a coin showing a portrait of President Trump. Lectures are off

SUMMARY:BayCare Presents: Im Fine\, Its Fine\, Everythings Fine!
LOCATION:Tampa \, FL United States
DESCRIPTION:Saying Im fine can be short and sweet but doesnt usually give 
 an accurate description of our emotions. Sometimes we use\, Im fine to mas
 k feelings\, avoid conflict\, and pretend that everything is okay. This pr
 esentation will explore what it means to minimize\, ways we can acknowledg
 e and honor how we feel in the present moment and how we can take ownershi
 p of our emotions in the new year to navigate us to our authentic selves.
