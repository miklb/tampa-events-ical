DESCRIPTION:Reclaiming the Time-In-Between A Somatic Journey into Flow\, P
 resence Nervous System Ease In music\, dance\, and poetry\, it is the tran
 sitions  the rests\, the pauses\, the moments between movements  that give
  everything meaning. Yet in modern life\, these spaces are disappearing. E
 very spare second is captured\, monetized\, and filled. We are pulled towa
 rd constant stimulation\, leaving almost no room for the quiet inner rhyth
 ms that regulate creativity\, intuition\, and wellbeing. This workshop is 
 an invitation to reclaim those time-in-between spaces and return to a natu
 ral state of flow  a place where the gears of go\, go\, go finally disenga
 ge. Mind and body need this extended neutral between gears: a place where 
 the mind settles\, the body softens\, and the nervous system can exhale. T
 hrough gentle movement\, breathwork\, somatic sensing\, and guided awarene
 ss\, youll explore: how to shift from sympathetic overdrive into parasympa
 thetic ease the role of the vagus nerve in emotional regulation and creati
 ve access how staring into space\, drifting\, and daydreaming are importan
 t for a healthy mind and body what it feels like to inhabit spaciousness r
 ather than urgency This workshop is fully experiential. Learning and doing
  are woven together to help you feel your way back to your quiet center\, 
 where clarity\, creativity\, and resilience naturally arise when given roo
 m. Youll leave feeling grounded\, restored\, and equipped with simple prac
 tices you can use anytime to regulate stress\, enhance focus\, imagination
 \, resilience\, and improve overall health and well-being. Teacher: Randy
