 onally acclaimed musical duo Seven Eyes will present Yoga Bliss - A Journe
 y to Inner Peace - an evening combining their critically acclaimed origina
 l music with the experience of inner peace through Sahaja Yoga Meditation.
  Concerts will be held on Friday January 23 at 7:00 pm\, Medical Academy a
 t D.W.Waters - Auditorium Katherine M Morse. Seven Eyes style is best desc
 ribed as ever-evolving world jazz music that is a harmonious blend of the 
 diverse cultures\, languages and musical genres that influence them. Seven
  Eyes compositions draw from diverse influences\, including Jazz\, Brazili
 an\, SufiHindustani music and Western classical music. The BBC Asian Netwo
 rk has called the music of Seven Eyes Uplifting\, mesmerizing\, everything
  that you want music to do! The duo have performed at prominent music fest
 ivals around the world\, and are regulars on radio stations such as the BB
 C Asian Network\, BBC Urdu\, and BBC World. Their two studio albums The Se
 ed and Senses have been enthusiastically received by audiences around the 
 world. Indie Berlin Review has commented\, This album (The Seed) isnt abou
 t just making things that sound cool and new. Both artists have a long\, i
 nvested and humble relationship with the traditions which they draw on. Th
 e combination of cultures is anything but a clash: its harmony\, its creat
 ion and its beautiful. Legendary guitarist Jimmy Page (of Led Zeppelin) ha
 s observed\, At the top of their game...Hes a wonderful guitarist! Sahaja
