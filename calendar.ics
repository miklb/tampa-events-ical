SUMMARY:New Exhibition: American Gaze - Impressionism
LOCATION:120 W Gasparilla Plaza Tampa FL 33602 Tampa \, FL 33602 United St
 ates
DESCRIPTION:Impressionism made its way to America from Europe by the end o
 f the 19th-century through artists\, dealers\, and collectors. It soon bec
 ame a national style of painting that evoked the growth of a modern nation
  with unrivaled natural beauty. For a short period in France\, from 1870 t
 o the 1880s\, the modern art movement known as Impressionism\, captivated 
 young American painters who were studying abroad at the cole des Beaux Art
  and Acadmie Julian. Their engagement with fellow artists\, museums\, and 
 gallery exhibitions in Paris and throughout France inspired their creative
  pursuits in the States. Impressionism\, with its bold brushstrokes and at
 tention to light\, shadow\, and color\, gained popularity throughout the e
 arly years of the 20th-century. American Gaze: Impressionism features a se
 lection of paintings from local collections that highlight the emergence o
 f Impressionism in the United States and the succeeding generation of arti
 sts who championed the genre. Featured artists include Mary Cassatt\, Will
 iam Merrit Chase\, Childe Hassam\, George Inness\, Claude Monet\, Theodore
  Robinson\, Maurice Prendergast\, Guy Wiggins\, John Twachtman\, and other
 s. All exhibitions included with admission \n\nPermalink: https://www.tamp

 down any remaining perceived barriers\, foster true understanding\, and en
 sure that these meetings are about the community and the police working to
 gether to develop shared solutions that enhance the well-being of every ne

 aluable insights and demonstrating how NHW programs contribute to Tampas c

SUMMARY:120-year Memorial Remembrance For Captain Samuel J. Carter

DESCRIPTION:NEVER FORGOTTEN TAMPA\, FL. (MAY 28\, 2025) - - The Tampa Poli
 ce Department will join the Tampa Police Memorial Committee (https:tampapo

  ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. On May 29\, 1905\, 36-year-old Ca
 ptain Samuel J. Carter was in charge of the department while Police Chief 
 J.S. Jones vacationed in Washington. Responding to the Seminole Heights ho

 by Ms. Dennis that her stepfather\, Phiander Knapp\, was hunting her down 
 with a gun. The two went looking for him behind Hillsborough High School\,

 tain Carter from 10 feet away. Captain Carter was initially taken to a nei
 ghbors house and then moved to his home at 1902 Taliaferro Ave\, where he 
 tragically died three days later. Knapp was arrested two hours after the s
 hooting. To honor his memory and the unwavering commitment of all our fall
 en heroes\, the Tampa Police Department will host a Memorial Remembrance C
 eremony on Monday\, June 2\, 2025\, at 11:30 am in front of the Monument t
 o Fallen Officers outside Tampa Police Headquarters. The ceremony will fea
 ture a tribute by the Tampa Police Honor Guard\, a solemn reminder of the 
 sacrifices made by Captain Carter and all who serve to protect our communi
 ty. The community is invited to join us in remembering Captain Carter and 
 help us ensure he is never forgotten. For those unable to attend\, the cer
 emony will be streamed live at facebook.comTampaPD (http:facebook.comTampa

 oft tissues in and around the spine. If we improve our body mechanics\, we
  may be able to prevent or correct most of the causes of back pain. After 
 this presentation\, you will be able to:  Define some of the anatomy of yo
