SUMMARY:Finding Neutral
LOCATION:211 South Howard Ave Tampa \, FL 33606 United States
DESCRIPTION:Reclaiming the Time-In-Between A Somatic Journey into Flow\, P
 resence Nervous System Ease In music\, dance\, and poetry\, it is the tran
 sitions  the rests\, the pauses\, the moments between movements  that give
  everything meaning. Yet in modern life\, these spaces are disappearing. E
 very spare second is captured\, monetized\, and filled. We are pulled towa
 rd constant stimulation\, leaving almost no room for the quiet inner rhyth
 ms that regulate creativity\, intuition\, and wellbeing. This workshop is 
 an invitation to reclaim those time-in-between spaces and return to a natu
 ral state of flow  a place where the gears of go\, go\, go finally disenga
 ge. Mind and body need this extended neutral between gears: a place where 
 the mind settles\, the body softens\, and the nervous system can exhale. T
 hrough gentle movement\, breathwork\, somatic sensing\, and guided awarene
 ss\, youll explore: how to shift from sympathetic overdrive into parasympa
 thetic ease the role of the vagus nerve in emotional regulation and creati
 ve access how staring into space\, drifting\, and daydreaming are importan
 t for a healthy mind and body what it feels like to inhabit spaciousness r
 ather than urgency This workshop is fully experiential. Learning and doing
  are woven together to help you feel your way back to your quiet center\, 
 where clarity\, creativity\, and resilience naturally arise when given roo
 m. Youll leave feeling grounded\, restored\, and equipped with simple prac
 tices you can use anytime to regulate stress\, enhance focus\, imagination
 \, resilience\, and improve overall health and well-being. Teacher: Randy

 onally acclaimed musical duo Seven Eyes will present Yoga Bliss - A Journe
 y to Inner Peace - an evening combining their critically acclaimed origina
 l music with the experience of inner peace through Sahaja Yoga Meditation.
  Concerts will be held on Friday January 23 at 7:00 pm\, Medical Academy a
 t D.W.Waters - Auditorium Katherine M Morse. Seven Eyes style is best desc
 ribed as ever-evolving world jazz music that is a harmonious blend of the 
 diverse cultures\, languages and musical genres that influence them. Seven
  Eyes compositions draw from diverse influences\, including Jazz\, Brazili
 an\, SufiHindustani music and Western classical music. The BBC Asian Netwo
 rk has called the music of Seven Eyes Uplifting\, mesmerizing\, everything
  that you want music to do! The duo have performed at prominent music fest
 ivals around the world\, and are regulars on radio stations such as the BB
 C Asian Network\, BBC Urdu\, and BBC World. Their two studio albums The Se
 ed and Senses have been enthusiastically received by audiences around the 
 world. Indie Berlin Review has commented\, This album (The Seed) isnt abou
 t just making things that sound cool and new. Both artists have a long\, i
 nvested and humble relationship with the traditions which they draw on. Th
 e combination of cultures is anything but a clash: its harmony\, its creat
 ion and its beautiful. Legendary guitarist Jimmy Page (of Led Zeppelin) ha
 s observed\, At the top of their game...Hes a wonderful guitarist! Sahaja
