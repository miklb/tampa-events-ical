SUMMARY:New Exhibition: American Gaze - Impressionism
LOCATION:120 W Gasparilla Plaza Tampa FL 33602 Tampa \, FL 33602 United St
 ates
DESCRIPTION:Impressionism made its way to America from Europe by the end o
 f the 19th-century through artists\, dealers\, and collectors. It soon bec
 ame a national style of painting that evoked the growth of a modern nation
  with unrivaled natural beauty. For a short period in France\, from 1870 t
 o the 1880s\, the modern art movement known as Impressionism\, captivated 
 young American painters who were studying abroad at the cole des Beaux Art
  and Acadmie Julian. Their engagement with fellow artists\, museums\, and 
 gallery exhibitions in Paris and throughout France inspired their creative
  pursuits in the States. Impressionism\, with its bold brushstrokes and at
 tention to light\, shadow\, and color\, gained popularity throughout the e
 arly years of the 20th-century. American Gaze: Impressionism features a se
 lection of paintings from local collections that highlight the emergence o
 f Impressionism in the United States and the succeeding generation of arti
 sts who championed the genre. Featured artists include Mary Cassatt\, Will
 iam Merrit Chase\, Childe Hassam\, George Inness\, Claude Monet\, Theodore
  Robinson\, Maurice Prendergast\, Guy Wiggins\, John Twachtman\, and other
 s. All exhibitions included with admission \n\nPermalink: https://www.tamp

LOCATION:Tampa \, FL United States
DESCRIPTION:Wednesday\, June 25\, 2025 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM One-half of all 
 working Americans admit to having back pain symptoms. Experts estimate tha
 t as many as 80 of the population will experience a back problem at some t
 ime in their lives. Heres the good news: Most cases of back pain are not c
 aused by serious conditions\, such as infection or fracture. Rather\, they
  are mechanical\, meaning the pain originates from the joints\, bones or s
 oft tissues in and around the spine. If we improve our body mechanics\, we
  may be able to prevent or correct most of the causes of back pain. After 
 this presentation\, you will be able to:  Define some of the anatomy of yo
 ur back and spine  Learn about the common causes and risks for back pain  
 Discover several strategies for maintaining good back health  Identify add
 itional resources for back health through your benefits with the City of T
