SUMMARY:New Exhibition: American Gaze - Impressionism
LOCATION:120 W Gasparilla Plaza Tampa FL 33602 Tampa \, FL 33602 United St
 ates
DESCRIPTION:Impressionism made its way to America from Europe by the end o
 f the 19th-century through artists\, dealers\, and collectors. It soon bec
 ame a national style of painting that evoked the growth of a modern nation
  with unrivaled natural beauty. For a short period in France\, from 1870 t
 o the 1880s\, the modern art movement known as Impressionism\, captivated 
 young American painters who were studying abroad at the cole des Beaux Art
  and Acadmie Julian. Their engagement with fellow artists\, museums\, and 
 gallery exhibitions in Paris and throughout France inspired their creative
  pursuits in the States. Impressionism\, with its bold brushstrokes and at
 tention to light\, shadow\, and color\, gained popularity throughout the e
 arly years of the 20th-century. American Gaze: Impressionism features a se
 lection of paintings from local collections that highlight the emergence o
 f Impressionism in the United States and the succeeding generation of arti
 sts who championed the genre. Featured artists include Mary Cassatt\, Will
 iam Merrit Chase\, Childe Hassam\, George Inness\, Claude Monet\, Theodore
  Robinson\, Maurice Prendergast\, Guy Wiggins\, John Twachtman\, and other
 s. All exhibitions included with admission \n\nPermalink: https://www.tamp

  the Tampa Police code for Community Meeting. By embracing our police code
  in the name of this new program\, we are signaling our unwavering commitm
 ent to genuine collaboration\, said Chief Lee Bercaw. Our aim is to break 
 down any remaining perceived barriers\, foster true understanding\, and en
 sure that these meetings are about the community and the police working to
 gether to develop shared solutions that enhance the well-being of every ne
 ighborhood. A primary objective of these summits is to support and expand 
 our network of Neighborhood Watch (NHW) Groups. Established NHW leaders wi
 ll be encouraged to connect with neighboring communities\, sharing their v
 aluable insights and demonstrating how NHW programs contribute to Tampas c
 onsistent ranking as one of the safest cities of its size nationwide. The 
 Signal 87 Summits are also designed to empower residents to identify and d
 evelop independent or shared solutions for concerns specific to their neig
 hborhoods that may not require a police response. To facilitate this\, rep
 resentatives from a variety of City of Tampa departments will also be pres
