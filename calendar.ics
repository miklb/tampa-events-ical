SUMMARY:Lecture: Ancient Athenian Ceramics: Through the Eyes of a Conserva
 tor
LOCATION:120 W Gasparilla Plaza Tampa \, FL 33602 United States
DESCRIPTION:In 1965\, Joseph Veach Nobles book The Techniques of Painted A
 ttic Pottery transformed the study of painted ceramics from ancient Athens
 . His careful examination of the structures and surfaces of these renowned
  and iconic objects continues to be one of the most cited scholarly refere
 nces even today. In the sixty years since that publication\, new scientifi
 c and technical insights have both enhanced and challenged Nobles study\, 
 bringing us even closer to the craft\, creativity and technical genius of 
 the potters and painters who produced ceramics in Athens thousands of year
 s ago. This lecture re-examines Nobles work\, this time by looking through
  the eyes of a conservator. New perspectives from the fields of experiment
 al archaeology\, materials science and art conservation allow us to glimps
 e the working lives of these ancient makers with even more clarity than be
 fore. Integrating these innovative new understandings of the ancient potte
 rs and painters artistic expertise and technical know-how also lets us see
  this broad range of ancient people in their fuller humanity. Lectures are
  offered free with the cost of daily admission: Art Museum Members: Free N
