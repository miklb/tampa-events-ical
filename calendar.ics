SUMMARY:120-year Memorial Remembrance For Captain Samuel J. Carter
LOCATION:Tampa Police Headquarters 411 N Franklin St Tampa \, FL 33602 Uni
 ted States
DESCRIPTION:NEVER FORGOTTEN TAMPA\, FL. (MAY 28\, 2025) - - The Tampa Poli
 ce Department will join the Tampa Police Memorial Committee (https:tampapo
 licememorial.org) to honor Captain Samuel J. Carter \, 120 years after his
  ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. On May 29\, 1905\, 36-year-old Ca
 ptain Samuel J. Carter was in charge of the department while Police Chief 
 J.S. Jones vacationed in Washington. Responding to the Seminole Heights ho
 me of Mabel Dennis at approximately 9:00 pm\, Captain Carter was informed 
 by Ms. Dennis that her stepfather\, Phiander Knapp\, was hunting her down 
 with a gun. The two went looking for him behind Hillsborough High School\,
  then on Franklin St. Knapp\, hiding behind bushes\, ambushed and shot Cap
 tain Carter from 10 feet away. Captain Carter was initially taken to a nei
 ghbors house and then moved to his home at 1902 Taliaferro Ave\, where he 
 tragically died three days later. Knapp was arrested two hours after the s
 hooting. To honor his memory and the unwavering commitment of all our fall
 en heroes\, the Tampa Police Department will host a Memorial Remembrance C
 eremony on Monday\, June 2\, 2025\, at 11:30 am in front of the Monument t
 o Fallen Officers outside Tampa Police Headquarters. The ceremony will fea
 ture a tribute by the Tampa Police Honor Guard\, a solemn reminder of the 
 sacrifices made by Captain Carter and all who serve to protect our communi
 ty. The community is invited to join us in remembering Captain Carter and 
 help us ensure he is never forgotten. For those unable to attend\, the cer
 emony will be streamed live at facebook.comTampaPD (http:facebook.comTampa

 aused by serious conditions\, such as infection or fracture. Rather\, they
  are mechanical\, meaning the pain originates from the joints\, bones or s
 oft tissues in and around the spine. If we improve our body mechanics\, we
  may be able to prevent or correct most of the causes of back pain. After 
 this presentation\, you will be able to:  Define some of the anatomy of yo
 ur back and spine  Learn about the common causes and risks for back pain
