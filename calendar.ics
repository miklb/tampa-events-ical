SUMMARY:Public Workshop - Multi-Modal Transportation Impact Fee
LOCATION:315 E Kennedy Blvd Tampa \, FL 33602 United States
DESCRIPTION:PUBLIC NOTICE OF PUBLIC WORKSHOP TAMPA CITY COUNCIL Two public
  workshops on a proposed increase to the Multi-Modal Transportation Impact
  Fee will be held by the City Council of the City of Tampa\, Florida\, on

 eafter as practicable\, in the City Council Chambers\, 3 rd Floor\, City H
 all\, 315 East Kennedy Boulevard\, Tampa\, Florida. Section 163.31801\, Fl
 orida Statutes\, authorizes local governments to adopt impact fees to fund
  the infrastructure necessitated by new growth. The Legislature recognizes
  that impact fees are an outgrowth of the home rule power of a local gover
 nment to provide certain services within its jurisdiction. The City of Tam
 pa originally adopted a Transportation Impact Fee in 1986 and in 2015 upda
 ted its fee structure to a Multi-Modal Transportation Impact Fee to incorp
 orate additional transit modes. The City of Tampa is considering an increa
 se to its Multi-Modal Transportation Impact Fee. Section 163.31801\, Flori
 da Statutes\, provides certain phase-in limitations that restrict a local 
 governments ability to increase the fee beyond certain thresholds. Pursuan
 t to section 163.31801(6)(g)\, Florida Statutes\, the City of Tampa may in
 crease its fee over the threshold set out in section 163.31801(6)(d)\, Flo
 rida Statutes. In addition to other statutory requirements\, the City of T
 ampa may increase its Multi-Modal Transportation Impact Fee above the thre
 shold after holding two publicly noticed workshops to consider the extraor
 dinary circumstances necessitating the need to exceed the statutory phase-
 in limitations. At the public workshops to be held on September 25\, 2025\
 , and October 30\, 2025\, at 9:00 a.m. or as soon thereafter as practicabl
 e\, in the City Council Chambers\, 3 rd Floor\, City Hall\, 315 East Kenne
 dy Boulevard\, Tampa\, Florida\, the City Council will consider whether th
 ese extraordinary circumstances exist. Interested members of the public ma
 y participate and be heard at this public workshop by either appearing in 
 person or virtually by using what is referred to by State of Florida statu
 tes and rules as communications media technology (CMT) as described below.

SUMMARY:Memorial Remembrance Ceremony in honor of Officer Anthony Williams
LOCATION:Tampa Police Headquarters - Monument to Fallen Officers 411 N Fra
 nklin St Tampa \, FL 33602 United States
DESCRIPTION:NEVER FORGOTTEN The Tampa Police Department will join the Tamp
 a Police Memorial Committee to honor Officer Anthony Williams\, 50 years a
 fter his ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. At just 27 years old\, Of
 ficer Anthony Williams became the third Tampa Police Officer to make the u
 ltimate sacrifice in a tragic three-month span. While off duty on the even
 ing of November 3\, 1975\, Officer Williams demonstrated profound courage 
 when he interrupted an armed robbery in progress at a local convenience st
 ore. Officer Williams stepped away from his familyhis wife\, Officer Ann W
 illiams\, also a Tampa Police Officer\, and their four-year-old sonwho rem
 ained in their car while he went inside for milk. Seeing three men robbing
  the store\, he instantly took action. He crouched near the entrance and c
 alled for his wifes weapon to confront the threat and protect the communit
 y. Auxiliary Hillsborough County Sheriffs Deputy Gary Barker\, who had bee
 n waiting in a back room as part of an anti-robbery detail\, emerged with 
 his pistol drawn as the crime was unfolding. The situation escalated quick
 ly as gunfire erupted. During the ensuing gunfire\, Officer Williams was f
 atally wounded. Showing incredible valor amidst personal tragedy\, Officer
  Ann Williams rushed from the car\, recovered her weapon from the ground n
 ear her fallen husband\, and fired her weapon\, striking one of the suspec
 ts. Deputy Barker shot another suspect\, and Officer Ann Williams was able
  to place him in custody as he stumbled from the store. The third suspect 
 was captured shortly after. All three suspects were convicted for their ro
 les in the robbery and the death of Officer Anthony Williams. Officer Anth
 ony Williams selfless final act of heroism is a reminder of the dedication
  demonstrated by police officers every hour of every day. His courageous a
 ctions saved lives that night and stand as a lasting testament to his dedi
 cation to the people of Tampa. To honor his memory and the unwavering comm
 itment of all our fallen heroes\, the Tampa Police Department will host a 
 Memorial Remembrance Ceremony on Monday November 3\, 2025\, at 11:30 am in
  front of the Monument to Fallen Officers outside Tampa Police Headquarter
 s. The ceremony will feature a tribute by the Tampa Police Honor Guard\, a
  solemn reminder of the sacrifices made by Officer Anthony Williams and al
 l who serve to protect our community. For those unable to attend in person
 \, the ceremony will be live streamed at www.facebook.comTampaPD. \n\nPerm
