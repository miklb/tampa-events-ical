SUMMARY:New Exhibition: The Etruscans: A Mysterious Italian People
LOCATION:120 W Gasparilla Plaza Tampa\, FL 33602 Tampa \, FL 33602 United 
 States
DESCRIPTION:The Etruscans are a fascinating ancient Italian people about w
 hom much remains a mystery. They inhabited an area of central Italy  prese
 nt-day Tuscany and beyond  immediately north of Latium where the city Rome
  later rose to power. Emerging from the Iron Age Villanovan culture (ca. 9
 00-700 bce)\, the Etruscans reached their zenith in the second quarter of 
 the first millennium bce. Over the centuries\, Etruscan art and culture re
 tained its distinct identity. Yet\, they were variously influenced by Celt
 ic and Central European\, Roman and Greek\, Punic and Phoenician civilizat
 ions. The Etruscans were gradually subsumed by Rome over the course of a l
 ong process of acculturation (ca. 5th-1st cent. bce). \n\nPermalink: https

SUMMARY:New Exhibition: American Gaze - Impressionism
LOCATION:120 W Gasparilla Plaza Tampa FL 33602 Tampa \, FL 33602 United St
 ates
DESCRIPTION:Impressionism made its way to America from Europe by the end o
 f the 19th-century through artists\, dealers\, and collectors. It soon bec
 ame a national style of painting that evoked the growth of a modern nation
  with unrivaled natural beauty. For a short period in France\, from 1870 t
 o the 1880s\, the modern art movement known as Impressionism\, captivated 
 young American painters who were studying abroad at the cole des Beaux Art
  and Acadmie Julian. Their engagement with fellow artists\, museums\, and 
 gallery exhibitions in Paris and throughout France inspired their creative
  pursuits in the States. Impressionism\, with its bold brushstrokes and at
 tention to light\, shadow\, and color\, gained popularity throughout the e
 arly years of the 20th-century. American Gaze: Impressionism features a se
 lection of paintings from local collections that highlight the emergence o
 f Impressionism in the United States and the succeeding generation of arti
 sts who championed the genre. Featured artists include Mary Cassatt\, Will
 iam Merrit Chase\, Childe Hassam\, George Inness\, Claude Monet\, Theodore
  Robinson\, Maurice Prendergast\, Guy Wiggins\, John Twachtman\, and other
 s. All exhibitions included with admission \n\nPermalink: https://www.tamp

LOCATION:Tampa \, FL United States
DESCRIPTION:Wednesday\, June 25\, 2025 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM One-half of all 
 working Americans admit to having back pain symptoms. Experts estimate tha

  are mechanical\, meaning the pain originates from the joints\, bones or s
 oft tissues in and around the spine. If we improve our body mechanics\, we
  may be able to prevent or correct most of the causes of back pain. After 
 this presentation\, you will be able to:  Define some of the anatomy of yo
 ur back and spine  Learn about the common causes and risks for back pain  
 Discover several strategies for maintaining good back health  Identify add
