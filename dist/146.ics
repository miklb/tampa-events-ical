SUMMARY:Antiquities Circle Lecture: An Introduction to Coptic Religion and
  Art
LOCATION:120 W Gasparilla Plaza Tampa \, FL 33602 United States
DESCRIPTION:An Introduction to Coptic Religion and Art Egyptologist and Cr
 itical Art Historian Dr. Robert Steven Bianchi returns to the Tampa Museum
  of Art for a lecture on the art and religion of the early Christian commu
 nity in Egypt. As Dr. Bianchi will explain in this lecture\, the noun Copt
  and the adjective Coptic are ultimately derived the ancient Egyptian phra
 se Hut-ka-Ptah\, the temple of Ptah\, which was used to refer to the city 
 of Memphis as a substitute for Egypt as a whole. Over time\, the word Copt
  came to identify the native Egyptians who converted to Christianity in th
 e early centuries of the Roman Imperial Period. The lecture will trace the
  growth of the Christian community in Egypt. From the traditional founding
  of the Church by Saint Mark\, during the early centuries\, the Copts were
  part of the Roman Empire. They shared a common material culture with thei
 r polytheistic neighbors that derived in part from pharaonic Egypt\, as we
 ll as Greece and Rome. During the 3rd century\, the Copts suffered severel
 y during the religious persecution of Christians. After the promulgation o
 f religious tolerance (313 ce) and then the establishment of Christianity 
 as the only recognized religion (380 bce)\, the Coptic community flourishe
 d. Even into the Islamic Period\, many Coptic traditions were allowed to c
 ontinue uninterruptedly. Today\, there is still a thriving\, vibrant Copti
 c community in Egypt. As the co-creator and host of a planned documentary 
 series on the intellectual legacy of the city of Alexandria\, Dr. Bianchi 
 will moreover share recent underwater discoveries of exciting archaeologic
 al remains which have tentatively been identified as architectural fragmen
 ts belonging to an original church associated with Saint Mark. Those finds
  set the stage for the discussion about the material culture of Egypts Cop
 tic Period within the context of the Roman Imperial and early Medieval Per
 iods in which many of the objects on view in this exhibition were created.
  Referring to a psali-Adam dated to the period between the 17th and 19th c
 entury\, which is on view in the exhibition\, Dr. Bob will summarize the d
 evelopment of the Coptic language and proceed to discuss aspects of doctri
 nal differences against the background of some of the opulently preserved 
 Coptic Churches in Egypt today\, notable among which is the magnificent Re
 d Monastery in Sohag. Lectures are offered free with admission to the muse
