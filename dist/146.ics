SUMMARY:Antiquities Lecture: Citizen Participation in Ancient Athens
LOCATION:120 W Gasparilla Plaza Tampa \, FL 33602 United States
DESCRIPTION:After the U.S. Presidential Elections in November 2024\, it is
  fitting to return to the birthplace of democracy\, Athens\, around the 6t
 h through 4th century BCE. Keynote speaker Dr. Jennifer Roberts traces the
  political reforms that led to the breakdown of the power of the nobility 
 and the rise of popular government within the larger context of ancient Gr
 eek history. As well as discussing the women and the enslaved population e
 xcluded from participation in government\, Dr. Roberts will explore the At
 henians rationale for denying citizenship to immigrants and their descenda
 nts in the context of anxiety about immigration in the United States\, beg
 inning with the founding era. Among those who did belong to the citizen bo
 dy\, she will ask how the Athenians arranged to involve men (not women) of
  all social classes in government. Identifying eight strategies for maximi
 zing citizen participation\, she will explore how the Athenians approach m
 ight be adapted to the large nation-states of the modern world\, the Unite
 d States in particular. \n\nPermalink: https://www.tampa.gov/node/163446

SUMMARY:Ceramics Continued Study
LOCATION:120 W Gasparilla Plaza Tampa \, FL 33602 United States
DESCRIPTION:Understanding how the past intersects with the present helps i
 nform our views of the world. As individuals\, we share recollections\, at
  times lucid and temporal\, at other times imprecise. We shape meaning aro
 und ideas\, values\, symbols\, customs\, and myths centered on historic in
 terpretation. The formation of ethos and identity\, like the articulation 
 of art\, serve as representations of this consciousness. Art\, like collec
 tive memory\, can be luminous and worldly at times\, and inexact at others
 . How does identity impact art? We address this question by contextualizin
 g the artists and paintings that comprise the collection\, Under the Spell
  of the Palm Tree: The Rice Collection of Cuban Art . \n\nPermalink: https
