SUMMARY:Antiquities Circle Lecture: Women Religion in Classical Athens
LOCATION:120 W Gasparilla Plaza Tampa \, FL 33602 United States
DESCRIPTION:Despite their lack of political and economic rights\, women we
 re critical to maintaining the religious system of classical Athens. As cu
 ltic citizens\, they joined men in honoring the gods and the city\, as wel
 l as celebrated their own rituals in both domestic and civic contexts in t
 he company of other women. Their association with fertility and reproducti
 on made them indispensable performers of rites connected with the agricult
 ural year. Women also served as priestesses\, as dedicators\, and as publi
 c benefactors. Women-only festivals further offered opportunities to build
  and strengthen female social networks\, to act autonomously and perhaps e
 ven to subvert social norms. Domestic rituals accomplished by women in tur
 n helped to mark the life stages and strengthen familial identity. This ta
 lk will discuss a few examples of womens religious activities in classical
  Athens\, drawing on some of the vases from the collection of Joseph Veach
  Noble as well as TMAs permanent collection as illustrations. \n\nPermalin
