SUMMARY:Ceramics Continued Study
LOCATION:120 W Gasparilla Plaza Tampa \, FL 33602 United States
DESCRIPTION:Understanding how the past intersects with the present helps i
 nform our views of the world. As individuals\, we share recollections\, at
  times lucid and temporal\, at other times imprecise. We shape meaning aro
 und ideas\, values\, symbols\, customs\, and myths centered on historic in
 terpretation. The formation of ethos and identity\, like the articulation 
 of art\, serve as representations of this consciousness. Art\, like collec
 tive memory\, can be luminous and worldly at times\, and inexact at others
 . How does identity impact art? We address this question by contextualizin
 g the artists and paintings that comprise the collection\, Under the Spell
  of the Palm Tree: The Rice Collection of Cuban Art . \n\nPermalink: https

 re de Desde una Pragmtica Pedaggica (DUPP)\, por el carcter netamente til 
 y reflexivo concedido al saber\, como prctica o metfora crtica de su carct
 er histrico. Este mtodo de enseanza tuvo varios momentos hasta el ao 2012
