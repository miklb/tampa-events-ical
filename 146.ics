 ge. Mind and body need this extended neutral between gears: a place where 
 the mind settles\, the body softens\, and the nervous system can exhale. T

  are woven together to help you feel your way back to your quiet center\, 
 where clarity\, creativity\, and resilience naturally arise when given roo
