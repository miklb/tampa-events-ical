DESCRIPTION:The Etruscans are a fascinating ancient Italian people about w
 hom much remains a mystery. They inhabited an area of central Italy  prese
 nt-day Tuscany and beyond  immediately north of Latium where the city Rome
  later rose to power. Emerging from the Iron Age Villanovan culture (ca. 9
 00-700 bce)\, the Etruscans reached their zenith in the second quarter of 
 the first millennium bce. Over the centuries\, Etruscan art and culture re
 tained its distinct identity. Yet\, they were variously influenced by Celt
 ic and Central European\, Roman and Greek\, Punic and Phoenician civilizat
 ions. The Etruscans were gradually subsumed by Rome over the course of a l
 ong process of acculturation (ca. 5th-1st cent. bce). \n\nPermalink: https
