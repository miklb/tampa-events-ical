SUMMARY:BLACK LOVE Classics Series - Carmen Jones
LOCATION:711 N. Franklin Street Tampa \, FL 33602 United States
DESCRIPTION:A unique project from Otto Preminger\, Carmen Jones is a moder
 nized (as of 1954\, anyway) take on the classic Georges Bizet opera Carmen
  . In this version\, Carmen (Dorothy Dandridge) is a flighty\, flirty fact
 ory worker who gets in trouble and has to be delivered to jail by a milita
 ry guard\, Joe\, (Harry Belafonte). He falls for her\, which Carmen finds 
 appealing\, if funny  and which his fiance\, Cindy Lou\, emphatically does
  not. If youre familiar with the opera\, or opera in general\, you know th
 is turns out poorly for all involved. A vivid and lively musical with a ti
 mely and humanistic flavor\, Carmen Jones is a one-of-a-kind mashup of the
 mes and emotions that are timeless in every way. Guests are invited to sta
 y after the screening for the film talk The Staccato Notes of Identity in 
 Carmen Jones\, led by Taylor Raye Curry\, Associate Professor of Film at U
 niversity of Tampa. The Black Love Classic Movie Series is presented by Ta
 mpa Electric (TECO) in collaboration with the City of Tampas Community Eng
 agement Partnerships Department. Post-show Film Talks are sponsored by Hun
 gry Bull Productions and the Restaino Family Foundation. Promotional suppo

LOCATION:211 South Howard Ave Tampa \, FL 33606 United States
DESCRIPTION:Reclaiming the Time-In-Between A Somatic Journey into Flow\, P
 resence Nervous System Ease In music\, dance\, and poetry\, it is the tran
 sitions  the rests\, the pauses\, the moments between movements  that give
  everything meaning. Yet in modern life\, these spaces are disappearing. E
 very spare second is captured\, monetized\, and filled. We are pulled towa
 rd constant stimulation\, leaving almost no room for the quiet inner rhyth
 ms that regulate creativity\, intuition\, and wellbeing. This workshop is 
 an invitation to reclaim those time-in-between spaces and return to a natu
 ral state of flow  a place where the gears of go\, go\, go finally disenga
 ge. Mind and body need this extended neutral between gears: a place where 
 the mind settles\, the body softens\, and the nervous system can exhale. T
 hrough gentle movement\, breathwork\, somatic sensing\, and guided awarene
 ss\, youll explore: how to shift from sympathetic overdrive into parasympa
 thetic ease the role of the vagus nerve in emotional regulation and creati
 ve access how staring into space\, drifting\, and daydreaming are importan
 t for a healthy mind and body what it feels like to inhabit spaciousness r
 ather than urgency This workshop is fully experiential. Learning and doing
  are woven together to help you feel your way back to your quiet center\, 
 where clarity\, creativity\, and resilience naturally arise when given roo
 m. Youll leave feeling grounded\, restored\, and equipped with simple prac
 tices you can use anytime to regulate stress\, enhance focus\, imagination
 \, resilience\, and improve overall health and well-being. Teacher: Randy

DESCRIPTION:Faces of Power: Stories Behind Portraits on Greek and Roman Co
 ins Ancient Greek and Roman coins preserve some of the most widespread por
 traits from antiquity\, showing how rulers wanted to be seen by their peop
 le and how artistic styles changed over the centuries. As the main way ord
 inary people saw the faces of kings\, emperors\, and rulers\, coins remain
  key evidence for understanding ancient propaganda\, political symbols\, a
 nd portrait styles. The relevance of this topic clear by the debate today 
 about who should appear on modern currency\, from Queen Elizabeth II to pr
 oposals for a coin showing a portrait of President Trump. Lectures are off
