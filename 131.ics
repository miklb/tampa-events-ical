SUMMARY:90 Year Memorial Remembrance in Honor of Officer Bryan A. Reese
LOCATION:Tampa Police Headquarters 411 N Franklin St Tampa \, FL 33602 Uni
 ted States
DESCRIPTION:NEVER FORGOTTEN TAMPA\, FL. (AUGUST 28\, 2025) - - The Tampa P
 olice Department will join the Tampa Police Memorial Committee (https:tamp
 apolicememorial.org) to honor Officer Bryan A. Reese \, 90 years after his
  ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Officer Bryan A. Reese\, a 30-yea
 r-old native of Edwardsville\, Alabama\, met a tragic end on August 29\, 1
 935. A respected member of the Tampa Police Department\, Officer Reese was
  assisting on a gambling raid when he was accidentally shot and killed whe
 n a a fellow officers gun discharged as he was grabbing a suspect. Joining
  the force in 1926\, Officer Reese had served the Tampa community for near
 ly nine years. He left behind a wife and a young daughter\, Emily Joan Ree
 se\, and his son\, Bryan Reese\, Jr.\, was born just after his death. A su
 bsequent inquest declared the shooting an unfortunate accident. Officer Re
 eses passing was a somber milestone for the department\, marking the first
  time the new 1935 police pension law would be used. His wife was granted 
 100 per month for life or until she remarried\, and his children received 
 a monthly benefit of 15 for the first year\, providing some measure of sup
 port during a time of immense grief. To honor his memory and the unwaverin
 g commitment of all our fallen heroes\, the Tampa Police Department will h
 ost a Memorial Remembrance Ceremony on Friday\, August 29\, 2025\, at 11:3
 0 am in front of the Monument to Fallen Officers outside Tampa Police Head
 quarters. The ceremony will feature a tribute by the Tampa Police Honor Gu
 ard\, a solemn reminder of the sacrifices made by Officer Bryan Reese and 
 all who serve to protect our community. The community is invited to join u
 s in remembering Officer Reese and help us ensure he is never forgotten. F
 or those unable to attend\, the ceremony will be streamed live at facebook
