 ltimate sacrifice in a tragic three-month span. While off duty on the even
 ing of November 3\, 1975\, Officer Williams demonstrated profound courage 
 when he interrupted an armed robbery in progress at a local convenience st
 ore. Officer Williams stepped away from his familyhis wife\, Officer Ann W
 illiams\, also a Tampa Police Officer\, and their four-year-old sonwho rem
 ained in their car while he went inside for milk. Seeing three men robbing
  the store\, he instantly took action. He crouched near the entrance and c
 alled for his wifes weapon to confront the threat and protect the communit
 y. Auxiliary Hillsborough County Sheriffs Deputy Gary Barker\, who had bee
 n waiting in a back room as part of an anti-robbery detail\, emerged with 
 his pistol drawn as the crime was unfolding. The situation escalated quick
 ly as gunfire erupted. During the ensuing gunfire\, Officer Williams was f
 atally wounded. Showing incredible valor amidst personal tragedy\, Officer
  Ann Williams rushed from the car\, recovered her weapon from the ground n
 ear her fallen husband\, and fired her weapon\, striking one of the suspec
 ts. Deputy Barker shot another suspect\, and Officer Ann Williams was able
  to place him in custody as he stumbled from the store. The third suspect 
 was captured shortly after. All three suspects were convicted for their ro
 les in the robbery and the death of Officer Anthony Williams. Officer Anth
 ony Williams selfless final act of heroism is a reminder of the dedication
  demonstrated by police officers every hour of every day. His courageous a
 ctions saved lives that night and stand as a lasting testament to his dedi
 cation to the people of Tampa. To honor his memory and the unwavering comm
