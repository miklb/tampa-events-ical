SUMMARY:Memorial Remembrance Ceremony in honor of Detective Juan Serrano
LOCATION:Tampa \, FL United States
DESCRIPTION:NEVER FORGOTTEN The Tampa Police Department will join the Tamp
 a Police Memorial Committee to honor Detective Juan Serrano\, 20 years aft
 er his ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Detective Serranos life and
  career were defined by a profound commitment to public service. Joining t
 he department in 1989\, he served with distinction across various roles\, 
 including Uniform Patrol and the Gang Unit\, before being assigned to the 
 Criminal Intelligence Bureau. In addition to his primary duties\, Detectiv
 e Serrano served as a vital member of the Mayors security detail. On the e
 vening of February 25\, 2006\, Detective Serrano was traveling home follow
 ing an assignment with Mayor Pam Iorio during the Gasparilla Distance Clas
 sic. As his unmarked vehicle entered the intersection at the southbound I-
 75 exit ramp and Gibsonton Drive\, a second vehicle traveling at a high ra
 te of speed ran a red light. The vehicle struck Detective Serranos car bro
 adside at the drivers door. Despite the efforts of first responders and me
 dical staff at Tampa General Hospital\, Detective Serrano succumbed to the
  injuries sustained in the crash. The occupants of the striking vehicle fl
 ed the scene on foot\, but the driver was later apprehended and charged fo
 r his role in the tragic collision. Detective Serranos dedication to the C
 ity of Tampa was evident in every assignment he held. His loss was felt de
 eply by his colleagues\, the Mayors office\, and the community he spent se
 venteen years protecting. His legacy remains a testament to the selfless n
 ature of those who serve behind the badge. To honor his memory and the unw
 avering commitment of all our fallen heroes\, the Tampa Police Department 
 will host a Memorial Remembrance Ceremony on Wednesday\, February 25\, 202
 6\, at 11:30 am in front of the Monument to Fallen Officers outside Tampa 
 Police Headquarters. The ceremony will feature a tribute by the Tampa Poli
 ce Honor Guard\, a solemn reminder of the sacrifices made by Detective Jua
 n Serrano and all who serve to protect our community. For those unable to 
 attend in person\, the ceremony will be live streamed at www.facebook.comT
